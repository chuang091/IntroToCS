<h1 align="center"> Hi this is my second web pages!!<br>I will introduce inherit and conflict</h1>

<h2 align="center"> First is inherit </h2>

<p>
  Here is <span>a span element</span> which is big font-size, as span elements are set to be.
</p>

<p class="extra" style="font-size:20px">
  Here is <span>a span element</span> which font-size is 20px, because it inherits from its parent, extra class (font-size is 20px).
</p>

<p style="font-size: 5px">
  Here is <span>a span element</span> wwhich is big font-size, as span elements are set to be, didn't affected by tag style.
</p>

<h2 align="center"> Second is confict </h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
li em2 { font-weight: bold; } <br>
h1, em { text-decoration: underline; }<br>
What are the differences b/t these two? 
</p>	

<p>
	We know that the HTML is nested structure(巢狀結構 我google 翻譯的) <br> see the first example <br>
	in order to call bold style, we have to use "li" tag cover "em2" tag, and the "em2" tag (bold style) will be valid.
</p>

<li> this is li part and <em2> this is em part and the bold works!! </em2>  </li>

<p>
	OK, so what is difference between these two, in the second example, I will show you that the comma in HTML means <bold> separate </bold>, <br> which means we assign the style value repectively.<br> In other words both "h1" tag and "em" tag will be assign or append the same style value
</p>

<em>
	hi (em tag)
</em>

<h1>
	hi (h1 tag: big,italic and <red>underlined</red> )
</h1>
